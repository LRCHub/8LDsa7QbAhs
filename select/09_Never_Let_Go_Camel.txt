Crazy preachers of our doom
Telling us there is no room
Not enough for all mankind
And the seas of time are running dry
Don't they know it's a lie?

Man is born with the will to survive
He'll not take "no" for an answer
He will get by
Somehow he'll try
He won't take "no"
Never let go, no

I hear them talk about Kingdom Come
I hear them discuss Armageddon
They say the hour is getting late
But I can still hear someone say
That is not the way

Man is born with the will to survive
He'll not take "no" for an answer
He will get by
Somehow he'll try
He won't take "no"
Never let go, no

Man is born with the will to survive
He'll not take "no" for an answer
He will get by
Somehow he'll try
He won't take "no"
Never let go

Never let go
Never let go
Never let go
Never let go
